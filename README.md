# Blackjack Game in Python

This is a simple implementation of the Blackjack card game in Python. The game follows the basic rules of Blackjack:

- The deck is unlimited in size.
- There are no jokers.
- The Jack/Queen/King all count as 10.
- The Ace can count as 11 or 1.
- The player can choose to 'hit' (get another card) or 'stand' (pass) during their turn.
- The player's goal is to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
- If the player's hand value exceeds 21, they bust and lose the game.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to start the game.
3. The game will deal two cards to the player and one card to the dealer (computer).
4. You can choose to 'hit' or 'stand' during your turn.
5. The dealer will then play their hand according to the rules.
6. The game will determine the winner based on the final hand values.

## Code Overview

- The game uses the `random` module to shuffle the deck and deal cards.
- It tracks the player's and dealer's hands using lists.
- The game logic is implemented using `while` loops and conditional statements.
- The game displays messages to the user using `print` statements.
- The game ends when either the player or the dealer busts or when the player decides to 'stand.'

This code provides a basic framework for a Blackjack game and can be expanded with additional features such as betting, multiple players, and more complex dealer strategies.
